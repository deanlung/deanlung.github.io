This is site about Dean Lung, a Chinese immigrant who arrived in the United States for the first time in 1875. Born in China in 1857, Dean Lung was listed as a member of the Carpentier household, residing at 108 East 37th Street in New York.

Like many other Chinese immigrants, Dean Lung was drawn to the opportunities in the United States, particularly in California. While there, he met Horace Carpentier (1824-1918), who held multiple roles such as being a trustee of Columbia University, a lawyer, an entrepreneur, and also the first mayor of Oakland, California.
